# Abortion_in_Europe
Computational Social Science project about abortion in Europe.

Linear (lasso and ridge regression) and non-linear methods (decision tree and random forest) are used to understand the variable importance and the association of some socio-economic factors on the abortion ratio in Europe. 

The pdf file "Analysis Abortion Ratio" is the final paper, which sums up in an organized way the analyses conducted with R and Python languages. The complete analysis can be found in the files:
- *Creation of the css dataset*: Jupyter Notebook which unifies several datasets used to collect the data
- *Choropleth map*: Jupyter Notebook which exploits a Europe geojson file to create two choropleth maps: one for the abortion ratio and the other for the fertility rate
- *Exploratory analysis*: Jupyter Notebook in which several plots have been used to have a first visual impression of the predictors across Europe
- *Analysis_css_copy*: RMarkdown file used to carry out an analysis in which the abortion ratio is considered as the response variable and the other variables of the dataset are the predictors
